# BeeProject

This project is part of my Master's internship at the **Research Center on Animal Cognition (CRCA)** in Toulouse.

## Description of the project

My goal will be to develop an individual-based foraging model of pollinators. I will reuse the code of Dubois et al (2021) that you can find **[here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8351995/)**. 

A more thorough description of my project can be found in my **[preregistration](https://fr.overleaf.com/read/vvdqzsmswbmn)**.

## Content of this repository 

* a **plots** folder containing interesting plots obtained throughout this internship
* a **resourcepartitioninginbees-V1.0** folder containing the R code by Dubois et al (2021) with additional files to analyze the data that were corrected by myself
* a **translation_python** folder containing my own attempt to translate the R code in Python
