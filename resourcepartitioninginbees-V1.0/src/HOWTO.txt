# Vector-based foraging model. 
# Â© Thibaud Dubois et al., 2020 April


Script to run simulation of our vector-based foraging model.
To use it, you have to input the parameters in 02-Parameters.R
Once all parameters are set, execute 00-main.R
(you need library "plyr" installed)

After execution, output files are to be found in the folder "Output" (in the directory of execution),
in a subdirectory named after the kind of setup, and a timestamp under the form YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.

Here is an overview of the outputs :
- arrayInfos : Review of the environment parameters used.
- arrayofMatrixDistance : For each bee during each bout, reports the absolute sum of changes in the probability matrix.
- matrixOfVisitationSequences : Sequences of flower visits. 
In the latter, the first three columns represent the simulation number, the bout number and the bee ident respectively.
The next columns report the sequence of visited flowers. 
The visited flowers are given by their ID in the corresponding arrayGeometry.csv. 
- routeQualityDF : The quality of route used (computed as reward obtained per distance travelled). 
See our paper for a more thorough description of this index.
