# Parameters --------------------------------------------------------------


########## CAREFUL: HOW TO INITIALIZE THE PARAMETERS ##########
'''
This code allows for testing different combinations of parameters in different simulations.

The genral architecture of each paarmeter is either:
	1. parameter = value, and this value will be used for each bee
	2. parameter = [value_for_test_1, ..., value_for_test_m], and m values will be tested in seperate simulations, each bee having the same value for this parameter. Please note that parameter = value and parameter = [value] is equivalent
	3. parameter = [list_of_value_for_each_bee_for_test_1, ..., list_of_value_for_each_bee_for_test_m], which is the same as in case 2 but here, each bee can have different values. The list of different values for eahc bee must IMPERATIVELY have the same length as number_of_bees.
Note that you can combine case 2 and 3 by specifying either a list or a single value for each test.

Let us take the example of alpha_pos, which is used during Q-learning to update the Q tables in case of a positive outcome.
	1. The parameter can take a single value: e.g. alpha_pos = 0.5
	2. The parameter can take a list of values: e.g. alpha_pos = [0.2, 0.5, 0.7]
	3. The parameter can take a list of lists of values: e.g alpha_pos = [[0.2,0.5], [0.5, 0.2], [0.7, 0.5]]

Remark: if you want to test 1 set of values for different bees (only 1 test but specify the value for each bee), do your_parameter = [your_list_of_values]. For example, alpha_pos = [[0.2,0.5]]

Please be careful when initializing parameters that are necessarily lists. Please find the instructions to initialize those specific parameters just below: 
	beta_vector (when use_dynamic_beta is True): this parameter always take a list of beta values for each bout. Therefore, to do only one test (precise the dynamic values of beta for each bee for one test) you must necessarily implement it such as beta_vector = [[list_of_value_per_bout_bee_1, ...,list_of_value_per_bout_bee_n]] 
	starting_bout_for_naive (when use_delay_start is True): this parameter must always take a list of values for each bee. Therefore, if you only want to test one set of values, do starting_bout_for_naive=[your_list_of_values]
